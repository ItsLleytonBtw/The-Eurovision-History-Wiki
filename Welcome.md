Welcome to the unofficial Obsidian Eurovision Song Contest History Wiki, created by ItsLleytonBtw.

This wiki is a work in progress and an experiment for me to test out the capabilities of Obsidian (and GitHub).

If you think of anything that I should change or add let me know through [Issues](https://github.com/ItsLleytonBtw/The-Eurovision-History-Wiki/issues/new).

I am in no way connect to any organisation linked to the contest, like [[European Broadcasting Union]], [[broadcasters]] or any media outlet, etc.
